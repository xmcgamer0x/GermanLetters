# GermanLetters

![](https://i.ibb.co/6wTn9FP/preview.png)

Tool which allows you to type german letters (Ää Öö Üü ẞß) on any keyboard.

On Startup it's running in the background. Pressing the [~] key activates the window, allowing you to type the desired letter.
The previous application (text editor, browser, etc.) keeps focus, so you just type like on a real keyboard.

GUI is localized to: English, Polish, Russian, German, Spanish.
